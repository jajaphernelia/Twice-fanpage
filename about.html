		<h2>New JYP Girl Group And Sixteen</h2>
		<p class="text"> On December 19, 2013, JYP Entertainment announced that they would debut a new girl group in the first half of 2014, the first female group to come out of the company since the debut of miss A in 2010. <br>
			On February 27, 2014, JYP trainees Lena and Cecilia were confirmed as members of the group, while other rumored members included JYP trainees Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Jisoo (later Jihyo) and Minyoung. <br>
			After Cecilia's departure, JYP trainee Sana replaced her and 6mix was about to debut when Lena left the company, effectively canceling their debut.<br>
			On February 11, 2015, Park Jin-young announced that the lineup of JYP's upcoming seven member girl group would be decided through Sixteen, a competition survival show that would air on Mnet later that year. <br>
			Park explained in a press conference prior to the show's airing that he hoped the group would "have the Wonder Girls' and miss A's natural, healthy feel, with an edgier and wilder side. <br>
			I want to upgrade this next group by adding elements like hip-hop and rap."<br>
			The show began on May 5 and ended with Nayeon, Sana, Dahyun, Chaeyoung, Mina, Jihyo, and Jeongyeon as the seven Twice members. <br>
			JYP then announced that he would be increasing the size of the group from 7 members to 9 by adding Tzuyu, who was the "audience's pick" since she was the most popular contestant by the show's end, and Momo, who was added by JYP himself since he felt the group needed someone with Momo's performance abilities. <br>
			The decision was controversial at the time with many people complaining about eliminated contestants being able to join the group.<br>
			Twice was to debut in late 2015.<br>
			On July 10, 2015, Twice opened their official Instagram account with the first picture of the nine members posing together.<br>
			JYP Entertainment released Twice TV, a web series that shared the members' hopes and stories through interviews and followed them as they prepared for their debut.</p>
